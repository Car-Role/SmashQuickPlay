IMPORTANT
If Dolphin is ever updated you must do this process again



Note: -The contents of this "Smash Quick Play" folder must stay grouped together
      -If the program ever doesn't respond go to the quick access toolbar and right click the shine. Select exit and restart the program.
      -Windows Only
      -Melee 1.02 Must be loaded into the default ISO directory in your Dolphin emulator
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup
1. Run Dolphin File Locator and follow the prompts
2. Run NetPlayHotkey and you're ready to go
3. Ctrl + f11 will generate a new host and copy the code to your clipboard
4. Ctrl + f12 will take HIGHLIGHTED TEXT and connect to that host.
5. Use Ctrl + arrow key up or down to change the buffer while playing!



Extra: 

While this Program is running you can change the buffer while being in game without having to navigate to the Dolphin NetPlay window with Ctrl + Arrow key Up or Down respectively. This is very useful for users on a single monitor setup.

If you want this program to run automatically on start up double click "Shortcut Maker"
You will need local Admin rights. This is a very small program and will not take up much resources at all.

If you want to remove that from start up simply double click "Shortcut Maker" and click remove
